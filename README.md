# Random javascript loader

A demonstrative script that runs randomly one of the 5 p5.js sketches I made.

I developed it for my website to change the background sketch of the landing page each time the website is loaded, without loading a (potentially) huge single javascript file.

In the example it runs with p5.js sketches, but it can run any javascript file.
